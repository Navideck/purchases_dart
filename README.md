## Purchases Dart

Dart implementation of [purchases_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/purchases_flutter) plugin

## Get Started

[purchases_dart] just imports [purchases_flutter] native apis and requires a store, we provide [purchases_dart_stripe] for stripe store, but `purchases_dart` is independent of store and can be extended with store of your own choice

Run `example` app, rename `example/lib/env.example.dart` to `env.dart` and configure revenueCat and Stripe keys
